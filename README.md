# Step-by-Step Instructions for Executing Code in Jupyter Notebook

# Import Necessary Libraries

Ensure you have the required libraries installed. The necessary libraries include:
* pandas
* scikit-learn (sklearn)
* numpy
* plotly
* matplotlib
* python
  
# Load Cleaned Dataset
Load the cleaned dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. This dataset will be used for the subsequent analysis and model training.

 # Model Training
Train the models using the relevant features from the dataset. This involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and then training two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

# Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained models using the following metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
These metrics will help determine the performance of each model and identify which one is more effective for customer segmentation.

# Calculations
Perform calculations to identify:

* The state with the highest total sales
* The state with the highest average sales
* The state with the lowest total sales
This involves grouping the data by state and aggregating the sales figures.

# Visualization
Create visualizations to better understand the data. Specifically, generate bar charts to visualize:

* Total sales distribution by state
* Average sales by state
These visualizations will help in analyzing sales performance across different states and identifying potential areas for targeted marketing strategies.

# Conclusion
By following these steps, you can effectively perform customer segmentation for LG Corporation, analyze the results, and visualize the data. This approach helps in understanding customer behavior, tailoring marketing strategies, and ultimately driving business growth.
